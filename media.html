            <td>Marchesa</td></td>
            <td>With social mediums becoming apart of our daily activities, Marchesa teamed up with IBM and their artifical intelligence known as Watson to create a dress that would change based on how people on Twitter would feel about the dress.</td>

          <tr>
            <td>Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton</td>
            <td>This luxury fashion conglomerate partnered up with Heuritech to invest in artificial intelligence to detect consumer patterns and behaviors to see what is trending and fashionable as well as obtaining more information on what their consumers want.</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>Sephora & Estée Lauder</td>
            <td>Both of these cosmetics companies have taken the usage of virtual reality and augmented reality to showcase how their products would look directly on the consumers face. This lets consumers decide if a certain shade or color works well with their styles without actually having to try on the product or even purchasing it.</td>

          <tr>
            <td><p>Amazon.com</p></td>
            <td>With Amazon Prime Wardrobe, you can try on numerous articles of clothing that is shipped to you and you can have up to a weeks time period and you can keep what you like and send back what you don't want. Additionally with the Amazon Echo, consumers can get advice and see what they would look like with the clothing item on. They are also developing technology to create clothing with fabric that'll perfectly fit the consumer.</td>
