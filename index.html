    <h2><em>Overview</em></h2>

        <p>Nowadays, it seems as it is almost unavoidable to have technology apart of your daily life. One industry that implements technology in creative and diverse ways is that of the fashion industry. This website will showcase numerous ways on how technology has become a new, vital part of the fashion industry. </p>


        <p>Fashion and clothing in general have been a thing since the beginning of time. To being simple garments to cover oneself to now setting a statement by what you wear. Now, fashion companies are using technological advancements to their advantage to create amazing and stellar ways for consumers to enjoy their favorite brands' products. Such methods that have been implemented are that of virtual and augmented reality that allows consumers to see the product that they are seeking within the comfort of their own home or without having to buy the product and test it themselves. This also reduces the usage of dressing rooms if you can see the clothes on yourself and see what different sizes look like based on your own body size.</p>


        <p>For example, mobile applications like that of Syte and Poq use user images to generate what an outfit would look like on an individual and compare the products that they're looking at and bring up other similar designed and looking products. Having such convinient technology in the palm of our hands is beneficial to get a product out to the consumer. Stores like Calvin Klein and The North Face utilize Fit Analytics and Clienteling Point of Sale software to help assist their customers find what they need efficiently and easily and solve problems like that of if a certain article of clothing doesn't fit properly and use that data to create products for that consumer and others alike to satisfy that demographic.</p>

        <p>Having this collaboration of technology and the fashion industry prompts new methods of analyzing supply and demand, developing newer, eco-friendly products, online promotions, taking social mediums into account, as well as new designing methods with CAD/CAM (computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing). With all of this, wearable tech like smart watches with Louis Vuitton accents can be made, smartglasses by Google and Warby Parker that has both the technological advancements as well as a fashionable design can also be made. One day, a blank shirt that can be programmed to have whatever design or color we want will be made due to this merging of two different industries. Technology allows us to achieve our dreams and fashion lets us wear what we dream.</p>
